<div align="center">

## Mouse enter,leave,hover and scroll


</div>

### Description

I think is a decent mouse enter, leave, hover and scroll sample one class and 4 lines of code to make it WORK. You can attach as many controls you want to the same class and set a custom time for the enter and hover events for each one. Enjoy it! It uses LaVolpe's self sub and callback code.
